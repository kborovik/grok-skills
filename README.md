  Spec-Driven Development (SDD)
</h1>

## What this is

**Code consistency is the casualty of LLM agent velocity.** 

LLMs write code faster than any human can read it — and faster than the agent can stay coherent with itself.
SDD keeps the spec small, dense, and durable.
It's the part the agent re-reads every turn, so task ten is built against the same constraints as task one.

The mechanics:

- **Every row has an address.** `§V.<n>` / `§T.<n>` / `§B.<n>` are stable cites — code comments link to the invariant they uphold, tests reference the bug they guard, commits cite the task they close. `SPEC.md` survives `/clear` and team handoff.
- **Telegraph encoding cuts tokens about 40%** vs prose for the same content (measured per-row mean 41%, median 39%, n=30 — see [`benchmarks/telegraph/`](benchmarks/telegraph/)).
  The savings come from terse grammar — dropped articles/filler, fragments, unpadded pipe tables — plus compact `§`-refs and a curated low-token symbol set (`→ ≥ ≤ ! ? § |`); Distinct from `steno` (the bundled human-facing shorthand).
- **Every test failure feeds back into the spec.**
  A `§B` row, usually a new `§V` invariant.
  The drift report stays trustworthy because every prior failure tightened the spec.
- **Main Grok does all the writes.**
  Code edits, `SPEC.md` mutations, status flips, commits.
  Read-only audits (e.g. `/sdd:check`) may fan out to sub-agents.
  No orchestrator.
  Same spec + same task produces the same plan.
- **Re-onboarding is one command.**
  Come back to the repo after a week, run `/sdd:check`.
  You get a read-only drift report: which `§V` invariants the code violates, which `§T` tasks remain.
  No digging through old transcripts.

> The spec is the only artifact that always justifies its token cost. Everything else must save more tokens later, save the agent's context, or be cut.

### SPEC.md is for the LLM, not you

`SPEC.md` is an LLM-facing artifact.
You operate it through Grok — `/sdd:spec` writes, `/sdd:build` and `/sdd:check` read, `/sdd:explain` decodes a citation back to prose when you want to read along.
The loop is `human → /sdd:* → Grok → SPEC.md`, not hand-editing in your editor.

That framing decides the format.
Telegraphic fragments over full sentences, pipe tables over bulleted lists, dropped line citations — all optimized for the model that re-parses the spec every command, not the human skimming it.
If you want to skim it as a human, `/sdd:explain` is the front door.

## Install

From this repo (local path):

```bash
grok plugin install /path/to/grok-skills --trust
grok plugin enable sdd
```

Or from GitHub once published:

```bash
grok plugin install kborovik/grok-skills --trust
grok plugin enable sdd
```

Then in any consumer repo:

```text
/spec      # or /sdd:spec when qualified — creates SPEC.md if missing
/build --next
/check
```

Plugin layout is Grok-native (`.grok-plugin/plugin.json` + `skills/*/SKILL.md` + `AGENTS.md`).

```

- **One spec file.** `SPEC.md`.
  No `docs/` tree, no JSON sidecars.
- **One writer.** `/sdd:spec`. (`/sdd:build` may flip a `.` to `x`; nothing else writes.)
- **Read-only commands write nothing.** `/sdd:check` (drift report) and `/sdd:explain` (decompression).

## SPEC.md format

Six fixed sections, fixed order.
Each row is addressable as `§<S>.<n>`.

```markdown
# SPEC

## §G GOAL

one line. what code must do.

## §C CONSTRAINTS

- non-negotiable boundary
- tech / language / library locked in

## §I INTERFACES

external surface — what the world sees.

- cmd: `foo bar` → stdout JSON
- api: POST /x → 200 {id}
- file: `config.yaml` schema …
- env: `FOO_KEY` required

## §V INVARIANTS

numbered. testable. each ! MUST hold.
V<n>: every req → auth check before handler
V<n>: token expiry ≤ current_time → reject
V<n>: DB write ! in transaction

## §T TASKS

id|status|task|cites
T<n>|.|scaffold repo|-
T<n>|.|impl §I.api POST /x|V<n>
T<n>|x|add §V.<n> middleware|V<n>,I.api

## §B BUGS

id|date|cause|fix
B<n>|2026-04-20|token `<` not `≤`|V<n>
B<n>|2026-04-21|race on write|V<n>
```

**Status markers:** `.` todo · `x` done.
**Cell rules:** literal `|` becomes `\|`.
Empty cell = `-`.
Backticks OK.

## Commands

### `/sdd:shape` — propose-then-critique (Plan mode)

Use when there's a structural choice to weigh — tradeoffs, named alternatives, subsystem shape.
Run `/sdd:shape <topic>` (or natural language that clearly asks to shape an SDD structure).
The skill enters **Grok Plan mode**, writes the proposal only to the session plan file, and iterates until `## Open Questions` is empty.
You approve the plan in the Plan mode UI.
Then fold with `/sdd:spec fold-shape` (mutates `SPEC.md` only).
No default `designs/` file — optional export only if you ask.
Name is `shape` on purpose so it does not collide with the bundled Grok `/design` skill.

```bash
/sdd:shape how should the release pipeline split monorepo plugins?
/sdd:spec fold-shape
```

Distinct from `/sdd:spec`'s socratic gate: socratic converges on **enough** (sharpen vague intent); shape converges on **exhausted** (every structural question has a decision).
Distinct from bundled `/design`: that skill is a general design-doc loop with a PR plan; `/sdd:shape` is the SDD funnel step.

### `/sdd:spec` — mutate the spec

The sole mutator.
The argument is **free-form intent** — the socratic gate (the bundled `socratic` skill) reads what you wrote and picks a mode.
You don't pick the mode yourself.

- no `SPEC.md` — possible modes **NEW** or **DISTILL**; concrete intent passes in at most 1 turn; vague intent triggers single-question dialogue to convergence.
- `SPEC.md` exists — possible modes **BACKPROP** or **AMEND** or **NEW** (rare, requires explicit re-init); mode emerges from the convergence triple — symptom + surface + recurrence-class for BACKPROP, §-target + delta for AMEND.

Examples (all free-form — the gate classifies):

```bash
/sdd:spec a CLI that ingests JSON over stdin and emits Parquet
/sdd:spec build the spec from this codebase
/sdd:spec V<n>'s `≤` should be `<` for unsigned tokens
/sdd:spec rate-limiter dropped requests under 100rps
/sdd:spec github issue 12   # fold issue → §V / §T (see Linear issue track)
```

### Linear issue track (solo, no PR required)

When work starts from a GitHub issue and you are solo on a linear SPEC, you do not need a branch/PR ceremony:

```text
/sdd:spec github issue N   # fold issue body → SPEC §V / §T
/sdd:build                 # implement; verify
git push                   # close trailer only after Acceptance gate
```

**Acceptance gate (issue close).**
Before any path that closes issue `N` (`Closes #N` / `Fixes #N` / `Resolves #N` on a commit or PR, or `gh issue close N`), build and the github workflow load the issue's `## Acceptance` checklist.
Each open bullet needs evidence (test name, code path, or CLI probe).
Unproven bullets **block** the close trailer.
When all open bullets pass, close is allowed and an Acceptance-evidence comment is posted on the issue.
If the issue has **no** `## Acceptance` section, that is an **advisory** (not a silent verified close).
The gate surfaces the gap; it does not pretend the work was acceptance-checked.

BRANCH / PR / MERGE stay available when you want them; they are optional on this linear track.

### `/sdd:build` — plan, then execute

Plan, then execute, then verify loop.
EXECUTE serializes on main thread; PLAN reads may delegate to sub-agents.

- `§T.n` — implement that one task
- `--next` — lowest-numbered row with status `.`
- `--all` — every `.` row in §T order
- `--no-chain` — skip the default same-turn hop into `/sdd:check` after a green pass
- (empty) — same as `--next`

**Green-path chain (default on):** after a successful close, the run continues into `/sdd:check` on the just-closed task in the same turn unless you passed `--no-chain`.

**Issue-linked close:** when the task or commit will close a GitHub issue, verify also runs the Acceptance gate (see Linear issue track above) before any close trailer lands.

Loop per task:

1. **PLAN** — cite every §V / §I the task touches, then proceed to EDIT.
   The plan is emitted inline for transparency, not a wait-state.
   Gaps are annotated so you can route them back to `/sdd:spec` post-hoc; the build never invents rules.
2. **EDIT** — make the change, run tests / build.
3. **VERIFY** — on failure, classify: (a) code bug, then fix and re-run; (b) spec wrong or unspecified edge case, then invoke `backprop` (via `/sdd:spec <cause>`), let it append `§B` and usually a new `§V`, resume against the updated spec.
4. **CLOSE** — flip `.` to `x` only when verification is green (and Acceptance gate allows any issue close trailer).

**Ambiguity is a spec defect, not a coding judgement.** `/sdd:build` never silently retries and never edits `SPEC.md` beyond flipping a status cell — every rule-shaped question routes back to `/sdd:spec`.

### `/sdd:check` — drift report

Read-only diagnostic.
Diffs `SPEC.md` against the working tree.
Always audits §V + §I + §T together.

- (empty) — memo-driven sweep: re-audits §V rows touched since last clean run; rest HOLD-SINCE-CLEAN.
- `--full` — force full re-classify: deletes `.spec/check-state.json` upfront, rebuilds memo.
- `--no-chain` — skip the default same-turn hop into `/sdd:build --next` after a clean report with pending tasks.

Output groups violations by severity and suggests a remedy — usually `/sdd:explain`, `/sdd:spec <intent>`, or `/sdd:build`.
On a dirty report it never auto-remedies.
On a clean report with pending work it chains into build by default (solo-operator default).

### `/sdd:explain` — telegraph to prose

The inverse of `telegraph`.
Given any citation, returns plain English with cited context.

```bash
/sdd:explain §V.<n>    # expand a specific invariant
/sdd:explain §T.<n>    # expand a task + every §V/§I it cites
/sdd:explain §B.<n>    # expand a bug + the invariant that catches recurrence
/sdd:explain --next    # expand the next unfinished task
```

Useful for code review, onboarding, or when you'd otherwise have to translate `every req → auth check before handler` in your head.

### `/sdd:condense` — token-budget sweep

Operator-triggered condenser for an oversized `SPEC.md` (advisory fires in `/sdd:check` when the estimate exceeds about 20k tokens).
Six prongs — fold sibling invariants, mark superseded tasks, archive old §T/§B rows to `SPEC.archive.md`, prune inlined history, rewrite prose to telegraph, extract heavy audit recipes.
Single atomic commit, rollback via `git revert`.

### `/sdd:reorganize` — §V cluster + renumber

Operator-triggered clarity pass (at most once per major epoch): clusters §V invariants by topic, renumbers them, and sweeps every citation in the same commit.
Renumber history persists to `.spec/spec-renumber-map.json` so old citations still resolve via `/sdd:explain`.

## Skills

Each skill dir surfaces directly as a slash command (e.g. `skills/spec/` becomes `/sdd:spec`).
SKILL.md frontmatter (`description`, `allowed-tools`, `model`) is honored on dispatch.

- `shape` — `/sdd:shape` Plan-mode structural funnel; Grok Plan mode propose-critique; fold via `/sdd:spec fold-shape` (not bundled `/design`)
- `spec` — sole mutator
- `build` — plan, then execute loop
- `check` — drift report
- `explain` — telegraph to prose decoder
- `condense` — token-budget condensation sweep
- `reorganize` — §V cluster + renumber + cite sweep
- `telegraph` — telegraph encoder (about 40% reduction vs prose); auto-fires on writes
- `backprop` — bug to spec protocol; fires on non-code-bug verification failures
- `socratic` — single-question intent gate; invoked by `/sdd:spec`
- `steno` — human-facing terse-prose register for reviewer-read text

You don't usually invoke `telegraph`, `backprop`, `socratic`, or `steno` directly — Grok picks them up from the command flow. `backprop`, for example, fires automatically when a `/sdd:build` verification failure appears to stem from under-specification (clear code bugs are just fixed).

## Workflows

### Greenfield — new project

```bash
/sdd:shape how should we shape the parser / renderer split?   # optional — only if structural Qs
/sdd:spec build a static-site generator that converts a Markdown directory into a single-page HTML bundle
# review §G/§C/§I/§V in SPEC.md, amend if needed
/sdd:build --next   # plan, implement, verify T<n> (scaffold)
/sdd:build --next   # T<n> (renderer)
/sdd:check          # before opening a PR
```

### Brownfield — existing repo

```bash
/sdd:spec build the spec from this codebase   # gate routes to DISTILL
/sdd:check                     # see what already drifts from the distilled spec
/sdd:spec V<n>'s bound is too loose for the rate-limiter   # gate routes to AMEND
/sdd:build §T.<n>              # tackle a specific task
```

### A bug just hit production

```bash
/sdd:spec webhook handler retried POSTs after 5xx, double-charged 11 customers
# gate routes to BACKPROP: appends §B, adds §V "POST handler ! idempotent on retry",
# adds a §T fix task, commits SPEC.md
/sdd:build --next              # failing test first, then the fix; commit cites the new §B/§V
/sdd:check                     # confirm new §V is now upheld
```

### Pre-merge sanity

```bash
/sdd:check
/sdd:explain §V.<n>            # if a violation is unclear, decompress it
```

## Telegraph encoding

`telegraph` writes telegraphic grammar — dropped articles, aux verbs, and filler, fragments, compact pipe tables — with a curated low-token symbol set (`→ ≥ ≤ ! ? §`).
Anything heavier is written as the ASCII word: a multi-token math operator costs 2–4 tokens vs a 1-token word, so a symbol is used only where it reads clearer than the word.

Result: every spec write lands about 40% leaner in tokens than the equivalent prose while staying machine- and human-readable.
The measured per-row mean is 41% (median 39%, n=30 across §V/§T/§B rows of this repo's own `SPEC.md`), reproducible via [`benchmarks/telegraph/telegraph-bench.py`](benchmarks/telegraph/telegraph-bench.py) — **full methodology, per-row results, and caveats in the [benchmark write-up](benchmarks/telegraph/README.md)**. `steno` (bundled) handles reviewer-facing text and keeps grammar intact so reviewers don't slow down.

Rules:

- Drop articles (a/an/the).
  Drop filler.
  Drop aux verbs where a fragment works.
- Short synonyms (`fix` over `implement`).
- **Preserve verbatim:** code, paths, identifiers, URLs, numbers, error strings, SQL, regex.

Full symbol table: `skills/telegraph/SKILL.md` SYMBOLS section.

**Example.**
Prose: "The authentication middleware must verify the token expiry on every request before allowing the handler to execute."
Telegraph: `V<n>: every req → auth check before handler`

If telegraph encoding slows you down on review, `/sdd:explain §V.<n>` decompresses on demand.

## Backprop in detail

Backprop is the one non-obvious thing SDD does that vanilla plan-then-execute doesn't.
Six steps:

1. **Capture** — record the failing case verbatim (test name, error, stack, repro).
2. **Trace** — find the cause: code bug, spec wrong, or unspecified edge case.
3. **Append §B** — add a row: `id|date|cause|fix`.
   Telegraph-encoded.
4. **Decide on §V** — would an invariant have caught the _class_ of this bug?
   If yes, add or tighten one.
   Cite it from the new §B row.
5. **Write the failing test first** — in the `/sdd:build` resume: watch it fail, then ship the fix.
   The test stays as a permanent guard.
6. **Two commits, cross-cited** — the spec commit lands first (§B + §V, via `/sdd:spec`); the code commit (test + fix) follows via `/sdd:build` and cites them.
   The record survives even when the fix is deferred.

Triggers:

- Test/build fails inside `/sdd:build` verification.
- `/sdd:check` reports a `VIOLATE` whose root cause is identified.
- User: `/sdd:spec <description>` — post-mortems, prod incidents, user reports; gate routes to BACKPROP on bug-class intent.

## FAQ

**Why Markdown, not YAML / JSON?**
Markdown + pipe tables grep cleanly, diff cleanly, render in every PR tool, and don't trip on quoting.
JSON specs invite tooling that defeats the point — the spec is for humans and one LLM, not a build system.

**Why one file?**
Sub-1000-line specs fit in context cheaply.
Multi-file specs invite cross-file inconsistency and force `grep` ceremony.
When the spec outgrows its budget (about 20k tokens — `/sdd:check` raises an advisory), `/sdd:condense` folds, trims, and archives old `§T`/`§B` rows to `SPEC.archive.md` instead of splitting.

**Does `/sdd:build` always backprop on failure?**
Only on failures that aren't clear code bugs.
Typos and wrong loop bounds get fixed without a spec change.
Anything that appears to stem from under-specification routes through `backprop`.

**Can I skip telegraph encoding and write prose specs?**
Yes, but every future load of the spec into context pays about 1.7x the tokens for the same content (the measured about 40% cut, inverted).
Optional in syntax, expensive in practice.
